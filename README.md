### **Song Playlist App (Java OOPs Project) 🎵**  

#### **📌 Project Overview**  
The **Song Playlist App** is a Java-based application that allows users to create, manage, and play songs from custom playlists. Built using **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, the app focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide a structured and scalable music management system.

#### **⚙️ Features**  
✔ **Add, Remove, and Modify Songs** – Users can add new songs to the library, remove unwanted tracks, and update song details.  
✔ **Create and Manage Playlists** – Users can create multiple playlists, add or remove songs, and reorder tracks.  
✔ **Play Songs** – Supports playing songs sequentially or in shuffle mode.  
✔ **Search Functionality** – Quickly find songs by title, artist, or genre.  
✔ **Persistence (Optional)** – Save and load playlists using file handling or a database.  
✔ **User-Friendly Console Interface** – Simple and interactive console-based UI.

#### **🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used**  
- **Core Java** – Implemented with Java Collections, File Handling, and Exception Handling.  
- **OOP Principles** – Encapsulation (data hiding), Inheritance (base and derived classes), Polymorphism (method overriding), and Abstraction.  
- **Data Structures** – Uses `ArrayList` or `HashMap` for efficient song storage and retrieval.  
- **File Handling (Optional)** – Saves playlists for future sessions using text or JSON files.  
- **Multithreading (Optional)** – Allows background music playback while users interact with the app.

#### **📌 Example Class Structure**
```java
class Song {
    private String title;
    private String artist;
    private String genre;

    public Song(String title, String artist, String genre) {
        this.title = title;
        this.artist = artist;
        this.genre = genre;
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Now playing: " + title + " by " + artist);
    }

    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    public String getArtist() { return artist; }
    public String getGenre() { return genre; }
}
```

#### **🚀 Future Enhancements**  
🔹 GUI-based interface using **JavaFX or Swing**.  
🔹 Database integration with **MySQL or SQLite**.  
🔹 Audio playback support using **Java Sound API**.  
🔹 User authentication for personalized playlists.  

This project is a great way to practice Java OOP concepts while building a fun and practical application. Let me know if you need help with implementation! 🎶🔥
